      <h2>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
      <h3>Personal information you disclose to us</h3>
      <p><em>In Short:</em> We collect personal information that you provide to us.</p>
      <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the Services, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.</p>
      <p><strong>Personal Information Provided by You.</strong> The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Names</li>
          <li>Email addresses</li>
          <li>Phone numbers</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Sensitive Information.</strong> We do not process sensitive information.</p>
      <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>
      <p><em>In Short:</em> Some information – such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics – is collected automatically when you visit our Services.</p>
      <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
      <p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.</p>
      <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Log and Usage Data.</strong> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).</li>
          <li><strong>Device Data.</strong> We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.</li>
          <li><strong>Location Data.</strong> We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect your location information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p><em>In Short:</em> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</p>
      <p><strong>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</strong></p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>To save or protect an individual's vital interest.</strong> We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual's vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li>
          <li><strong>To publish blog posts.</strong> We may process your information to make blog posts live.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p><em>In Short:</em> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>
      <p><strong>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your personal information with vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("third parties") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. The third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Firebase services:</strong> Google LLC</li>
          <li><strong>Web Hosting:</strong> Netlify, Inc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p>

      <h2>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p><em>In Short:</em> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
      <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>
      <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

      <h2>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
      <p><em>In Short:</em> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
      <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

      <h2>6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
      <p><em>In Short:</em> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
      <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
      <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
      <h3>Account Information</h3>
      <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
          <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Legal Terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>

      <h2>7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
      <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online Browse activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

      <h2>8. DO OTHER REGIONS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
      <p><em>In Short:</em> You may have additional rights, depending on the country you reside in.</p>
      <h3>New Zealand</h3>
      <p>We commit to protect your personal information under the safeguards of the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 (NZPA 2020). This means that if you are a resident of New Zealand, you have the right to request access to your personal information and request that it be corrected or deleted.</p>
      <p>We may need to confirm your personal information before the categorization of information is complete. If you are a resident of New Zealand, you have the right to request a complete copy of information from New Zealand's privacy commissioner in the case of any privacy complaint. This is a complimentary service. Examples of information we may ask for include your date of birth, country of residence, and contact information.</p>

          <li>request to opt out of the collection and use of your information</li>
          <li>request for us to take steps to remove your personal information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can exercise these rights by contacting us.</p>

      <h2>9. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
